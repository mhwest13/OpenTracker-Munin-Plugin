                MUNIN Plugin for OPENTRACKER
               ==============================

Munin plugin for graphing information out of OpenTracker

OpenTracker: http://erdgeist.org/arts/software/opentracker/

Munin: http://munin-monitoring.org


What does this plugin do?

This plugin graphs the stats information which come out of OpenTracker.


INSTALLATION
============

* This was tested against Munin v1.4.x (Master / Client) but should be compatible with v1.2.x *

1) Dependencies
    - Opentracker
    - Perl Modules: File::Basename; LWP::UserAgent

2) Make sure the plugin lives in /usr/share/munin/plugins/ as 
    * This of course depends on which plugin you have downloaded.
    * The plugin must be called up using symlinks so it knows which graph your are trying to fetch information for.*

3) Inform Munin of plugin dependencies, add necessary options

    In /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/opentracker
    [opentracker*]
    env.host 127.0.0.1      *default*
    env.port 6969           *default*
    env.uri /stats          *default*

4) Let's see if munin can detect and use the plugin with its internal calls.

munin-node-configure --suggest | grep opentracker_

Should return this if everything checks out...

opentracker_ | no | yes (conn peer scrp syncs tcp4 torr udp4)

5) Let's see what munin thinks our symlinks should look like for plugin execution.

munin-node-configure --suggest --shell | grep opentracker_

    Should return this if everything checks out...

    ln -s '/usr/share/munin/plugins/opentracker_' '/etc/munin/plugins/opentracker_conn'
    ln -s '/usr/share/munin/plugins/opentracker_' '/etc/munin/plugins/opentracker_peer'
    ln -s '/usr/share/munin/plugins/opentracker_' '/etc/munin/plugins/opentracker_scrp'
    ln -s '/usr/share/munin/plugins/opentracker_' '/etc/munin/plugins/opentracker_syncs'
    ln -s '/usr/share/munin/plugins/opentracker_' '/etc/munin/plugins/opentracker_tcp4'
    ln -s '/usr/share/munin/plugins/opentracker_' '/etc/munin/plugins/opentracker_torr'
    ln -s '/usr/share/munin/plugins/opentracker_' '/etc/munin/plugins/opentracker_udp4'

6) Restart munin-node
